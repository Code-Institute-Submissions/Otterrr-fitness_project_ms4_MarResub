# Deployments

## Heroku

This project was deployed to Heroku through the following steps:




## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking is the action of creating a copy of the original file on your own GitHub account to view and/or edit without making changes to the original repository. To do this:

1. Log in to GitHub and find the GitHub Repository you wish to use.
2. At the top of the Repository, below the Repository title, find the "Fork" button in the menu.
3. A new copy of your own should now be located in your own GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and find the GitHub Repository you wish to use.
2. At the top of the Repository, above the most recent commit, click "Code" then choose your option for Cloning.
3. To clone using HTTPS, copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS".
4. Now open Git Bash.
5. Choose the location you wish to save the cloned directory.
6. Type `git clone`, then paste the URL copied in Step 3.

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Otterrr/fitness_project_ms4.git
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Otterrr/fitness_project_ms4.git

* [BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Various functions and code snippets were adapted upon from the mini-project as well as bootstrap. All code where appropriate was typed by hand and functions and variables were renamed for my own project.
